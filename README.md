# IntelliTect.Snippets
##### *A VSIX extension for sharing code snippets.*

To add a snippet, change the extension of your xml file to `.snippet` and place it in the IntelliTect.Snippets folder associated with the language of the Snippet in the IntelliTect.Snippets project. (e.g. A C# Snippet would be place in the *IntelliTect.Snippets* folder inside the CSharp folder:  Snippets -> CSharp -> *IntelliTect.Snippets* ). Then add the shortcut and description of your snippet to the table here in the README.

If adding a language you can refer to this [guide for help.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/how-to-distribute-code-snippets?view=vs-2019)

New snippets that are pulled into Master will automatically be published to the latest version of the IntelliTect.Snippets VSIX extension (See updates).
