# IntelliSnippets
##### *A VSIX extension for sharing code snippets.*

To add a snippet, change the extension of your xml file to `.snippet` and place it in the IntelliSnippets folder associated with the language of the Snippet in the IntelliSnippets project. (e.g. A C# Snippet would be place in the *IntelliSnippets* folder inside the CSharp folder:  Snippets -> CSharp -> *IntelliSnippets* ). Then add the shortcut and description of your snippet to the table here in the README.

If adding a language you can refer to this [guide for help.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/how-to-distribute-code-snippets?view=vs-2019)

New snippets that are pulled into Master will automatically be published to the latest version of the IntelliSnippets VSIX extension (See updates).



### Updates
To automatically have the latest IntelliSnippets at you disposal, be sure to have automatic updates enabled under **Extensions** in Visual Studio's options:
